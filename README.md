We noticed that due to COVID, many industries fot affected. Some got recovered, some got bankrupt whereas some are still recovering.
Therefore, we tried to find out first that which industries got affected the worst. Lastly, we devised a policy that the government should follow so that these industries can survive and their employees can sustain a life.
Code folder contains the code to download the data and clean it. Data folder contains all the stock price history of certain industries and plots of the same.
Finally we have the report where we discussed about the project outcome and discussed our findings.
